Find a quiet and comfortable place to sit. Sit with your back straight and hands resting comfortably. Gently close your eyes or keep a soft gaze.
Take a deep breath in through your nose, feeling your chest and abdomen expand. Exhale slowly through your mouth, feeling the release of tension. Let your whole body relax.
Shift your focus to your breath. Notice the sensation of each inhale and exhale. Feel the cool air entering your nostrils and the warm air leaving. Take slow breaths.
If your mind starts to wander, that's okay. Gently guide your attention back to your breath without judgment.
Continue to breathe mindfully, fully present in each breath. If your thoughts drift, acknowledge them and return to the breath.
After 5-10 minutes, slowly open your eyes, take a moment to reorient yourself, and carry the sense of mindfulness into your day.`,

Find a comfortable seat and close your eyes. Take a few moments to center yourself with a few deep breaths.
Begin by bringing someone you love to mind, perhaps a close friend or family member. Picture their face and generate feelings of warmth and love.
Silently repeat phrases like, “May you be happy, may you be healthy, may you be safe, may you be at ease.” Feel the sincerity in each wish.
Extend these wishes to yourself: “May I be happy, may I be healthy, may I be safe, may I be at ease.” Embrace the positive intentions for your own well-being.
Gradually extend these wishes to others in your life, and even to those you may find challenging. Allow the loving-kindness to radiate outward.
Take a few moments to sit in the warmth of these feelings. When you're ready, open your eyes, carrying this sense of love into your interactions.

Find a comfortable place to sit. Close your eyes, take a deep breath, and imagine yourself at the edge of a peaceful forest.
Picture the entrance and start to walk slowly into the forest. Feel the crunch of leaves beneath your feet.
Notice the tall trees surrounding you, their branches forming a canopy overhead. Listen to the rustling of leaves in the gentle breeze.
Take in the scents of earth and pine. Take in the smell of the woods. Feel the cool shade and warmth of dappled sunlight on your skin.
Continue walking deeper into the forest, exploring its beauty and serenity. Notice the golden light dancing in and out of the shadows of trees. Allow yourself to be fully present in this natural setting.
When you're ready, open your eyes, bringing the tranquility of the forest with you.

Sitting comfortably or lying down with eyes closed, let's begin by becoming aware of the breath......

Feel the breath as it enters with a cool feeling and then warming as it gently travels down into the lungs.....

Fill the lungs with a deep inhale, bringing in energy, vitality and prana, the life force.....

As you exhale, feel the body releasing toxins, stress and any negativity that has accumulated.....

Stay with this breath, focusing on the feeling of deep peace for ten deep inhalations and exhalations....

Feel the energy that is in the body....

Become aware of the warmth and tingling of every cell.....

Feel the energy that is in the extended environment, in every part of nature and in every living thing.....

Bring all those energies together and feel them as one.....

Visualize all of that energy shining brightly, as the sun.....

Bring the shining glow of bright energy over the crown of the head.....

Feel it starting to travel down into your body from the top of your head, slowly going down into your face and neck, traveling down into the shoulders, all the way down into the arms, down to the fingers.....

Feel the healing energy and light going down into your chest, all the way down to your hips.....

Feel it continue traveling down your legs all the way down to your toes.....

Your whole body is now filled with divine healing light and energy.....

Allow that healing energy to completely fill any physical area that needs healing energy.....

Feel it warming, healing and expanding through the area......

Allow the healing light to bring peace and healing to any emotional issues or traumas.....

Bring your awareness to any intentions or desires that you may have.....

Hold the thoughts of those intentions or desires as you allow the healing energy to bring your deepest desires to life and your intentions into reality.....

Feel your connection to divine energy and light, and know that all is ONE.

Stay with this deep, relaxing, peaceful feeling of bliss.

Make yourself comfortable either sitting or lying down. Move around as much as you want to until you feel settled. During meditation don’t be afraid of moving, or coughing, tummies rumbling etc, it’s all natural.
Now become aware of your breathing. Don’t try to force any sort of rhythm, just let it become slower and natural, at a pace which is right for you.

Quietly scan down your body beginning with the crown of your head, take a deep breath and release any tension on your out breath. Let this feeling of relaxation soften the muscles around your face, temples and jaw. Don’t clench your teeth and let your tongue rest gently on the roof of your mouth.

Take another deep breath and become aware of any tension in your neck and shoulders. Breathe in and as you exhale, let your shoulders drop becoming soft and relaxed. Let this feeling of relaxation spread down your arms and into your fingers, down your chest and abdomen, your back and legs right down to your toes. Breathe to your own rhythm and let your whole body become heavy, soft and relaxed.

It's a summer day and I want you to imagine that you are sat down on a mountain top at dusk. It is very safe and you have nothing to do but relax. As you look around you, you can see the sun finally disappearing on the horizon as darkness begins to descend.

You lie down on the soft blanket you have brought with you and rest your head comfortably on your soft pillow looking up at the night sky. You feel completely safe and relaxed.

You see a full moon shining down on you and stars begin to appear twinkling in the night sky. As you watch, the sky becomes darker, the moon and stars become brighter.

As you settle into watching, you become aware of a faint green ribbon of light in the distance, like a wisp of smoke, as it gets closer to you, it becomes more solid in colour and a brighter green. The green light gently rests above you now sending its healing through the physical body. Let that green energy flow over the cells, down into the centre of each cell within your body leaving them energised and cleansed.

Now you become aware of a faint pink ribbon of light in the distance, like a wisp of smoke, as it gets closer to you, it becomes more solid in colour and a brighter pink. The pink light gently rests above you now sending its healing through the emotional body. Let that pink energy flow over each and every cell, down into the centre of each cell within your body leaving a beautiful layer of pink over the green.

Now you can see a faint blue ribbon of light in the distance, like a wisp of smoke, as it gets closer to you, it becomes more solid in colour and a brighter blue. The blue light gently rests above you now sending its healing through the mental body. Let that blue energy flow over the cells, down into the centre of each cell within your body leaving a beautiful layer of blue over the green and pink.

Now you become aware of a faint purple ribbon of light in the distance, like a wisp of smoke drifting lazily towards you. As it gets closer to you, it becomes more solid in colour and a brighter purple. The purple light gently rests above you now sending its healing through the spiritual body. Let that purple energy fill every cell, down deep into the Master blueprint of your DNA, leaving a layer of purple and raising the vibrations of the green physical, the pink emotional and the blue mental into the more perfect vibrations of the violet ray.

The green, pink, blue and purple lights have now merged into a beautiful violet healing light within your body. Feel it moving within you and coating the cells with its wonderful healing energy. Stay with this feeling for a few moments.

The healing lights have been absorbed gently into your body and it’s now time to leave the mountain and become aware of your own surroundings. You become aware of your body as you slowly become more awake feeling energised and refreshed. Take your time to come around fully, wriggle your fingers and toes and have a good stretch. You can return to this mountain anytime you feel the need for healing.

Close your eyes and settle into your breath. Place one hand on your belly, the other on your heart and become aware of your body rising with each inhale and lowering with every exhale. Draw a deep breath in through your nose. Pause. And exhale out your mouth. Do this again. Deeply through your nose. Hold. And let it go. One more time. Filling your lungs fully. Holding. And releasing.

Now let your breath return to normal. No longer changing it. Just letting it be.
Bring attention to how your body feels now. Where you feel it connected to your mat. Noticing any places of tension and imagining your breath going to them and allowing them to surrender and release.
You should feel completely at ease. Calm. Secure.
You now are ready to take an inner journey.
You are standing on a sandy beach. You look out and you see a beautiful calm ocean. Water as far as you can see and gentle waves rolling in towards you. You can smell the salt air. You can hear birds calling playfully. You look down at your feet and feel your toes curling into the soft sand. The sand is pleasantly warm and feels nice between your toes.
You look around you and realize you are alone on this beautiful beach. This does not bother you. You are enjoying spending time on this beautiful day. The sun is warm yet there is a gentle breeze and your feel amazing.
You notice a trail of beautiful shells and you begin following them, picking up each shell as you come apon it. With each one you pick up, you feel lighter. Stronger. Happy.
You come to the end of this trail and pick up the last beautiful shell and you realize that it has led you what seems to be a hand mirror just laying there on this beach. Almost like it was waiting just for you. It is ornate and beautiful. You can’t help but pick it up and look at your reflection. When you do, you realize it is a special mirror that sees you truthfully. It sees you strong, intelligent, beautiful and capable of doing anything you wish to do. As you look at yourself and allow these feelings of self love to sink in, you feel happy. Content. Inspired.

When you are ready, you return the mirror to its place on the sandy beach, knowing that you can find it again any time you need. And slowly make your way back up the beach, listening to the birds and the waves gently rolling. Feeling happier. Free. Strong.
Once you return back to where you began, you return your focus to the beginning. To listening to every inhale and exhale.

Rested and comfortable - you take a long, deep inhale of fresh clean air and your head turns up to greet the sun. The sky is a beautiful, rich shade of blue and the white clouds float effortlessly by. The sun’s energy rushes over you and you feel a sense of warmth, like a big hug, surrounding your body. The soft, cool green grass cradles your feet and every step you take is cushioned by nature. As you walk you hear the gentle sound of a stream, trickling to a sweet and slow rhythm. It calls to you to dip your feet into the water. Standing on sand and smooth rocks, the lazy current hums and the water glistens in the beautiful sunlight. Your reflection smiles back and you – it mirrors the complete happiness you are feeling as you are living and appreciating this very moment in your life.

Looking around, you notice the occasional leaf falling slowly, like a floating feather from the trees to a sweet and soft landing on the stream – then the leaves take a calm and relaxing ride on the water. A light and easy breeze rustles the leaves in the trees. A gold glowing light peeks through the branches.

As you continue on the grassy path, the sun dries the water from your feet and you walk in nature, in pure happiness. You follow the lightness of the sun and are guided to a beautiful white hammock connected to magnificent Oaks, sturdy and strong. You lie into the hammock, slowly and as it supports all of your weight with ease, you lay your head on the large, soft pillow. Your entire body is supported and as the hammock cradles you, your eyes grow heavy and soft. The light breeze sways you so gently, from side to side and the sun warms you from head to toe. You are completely held with love by the glorious Oaks, completely whole, and completely and peacefully settled in your own space in time.
